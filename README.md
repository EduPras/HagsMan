**States**:

- 0 - Waiting for connection;  
- 1 - Select the first player to choose the word;  
- 2 - Receiving attempts from the player who is trying to guess the word and sending the responses to the other player. This state occurs twice â€” on the second time, the roles are reversed;  
- 3 - Players deciding whether to play again. If both choose to play again, go to state 1. If both choose to quit, terminate. If only one wants to play again, return to state 0 to wait for another connection.
